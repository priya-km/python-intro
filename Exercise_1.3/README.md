# Exercise 1.3
<h2>Task</h2>

<p> The goal is to read any number of recipes from the user, and then add them into a list for later use, along with another list for the ingredients that you’ve come across so far. Once this is complete, you’ll display each recipe with its details, along with an extra feature—the difficulty level. You’ll have the difficulty level of each recipe calculated and displayed (there’s no need to store them) based on a few of its own attributes.</p><br>
