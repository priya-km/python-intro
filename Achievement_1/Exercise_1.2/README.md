# Exercise 1.2
## Task

<h3>1. Create a structure named recipe_1 that contains the following keys:<br></h3>
name (str): Contains the name of the recipe<br>
cooking_time (int): Contains the cooking time in minutes<br>
ingredients (list): Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type<br>
<br>
<h4>I have decided to use dictionaries as the data structure for the recipes as it will allow me to store the different data types needed as well as an array/list for the ingredients. With dictionaries I'm able to store data in key value pairs which is what I see is needed for the layout of the recipes.</h4>
<br>
<h3>2. The recipe_1 structure that you create will be for a cup of tea, with the following attributes:<br></h3>
Name: Tea<br>
Cooking time: 5 minutes<br>
Ingredients: Tea leaves, Sugar, Water<br><br>
 
<h3>3. Create an outer structure called all_recipes, and then add recipe_1 to it. </h3><br>

<h4>For the outer structure I've chosen to use a list. I realized using a dictionary wouldn't work as I went through the steps which you can see in the screenshots. The more important reason for the choice being that with lists I can store multiple recipes that can be modified if needed.</h4> <br>

<h3>4. Generate 4 more recipes as recipe_2, recipe_3, recipe_4, and recipe_5, and then add them as well to all_recipes.</h3>

<h3>5. Once youâ€™re done setting up all_recipes, print the ingredients of each recipe as five different lists, inside the IPython shell.<br></h3>
