<h1>Objective</h1>
Build the command line version of a Recipe app. Users should be able to create and modify recipes with ingredients, cooking time, and a difficulty
parameter that would be automatically calculated by the app. Your users should also be able to search for
recipes by their ingredients.

<h1>Key Features</h1>
● Create and manage the user’s recipes on a locally hosted MySQL database. <br>
● Option to search for recipes that contain a set of ingredients specified by the user.<br>
● Automatically rate each recipe by their difficulty level.<br>
● Display more details on each recipe if the user prompts it, such as the ingredients, cooking time,
and difficulty of the recipe.<br>

<h1>Technical Requirements</h1>
● The app should handle any common exceptions or errors that may pop up either during user
input, database access, for example, and display user-friendly error messages.<br>
● The app must connect to a MySQL database hosted locally on your system.<br>
● The app must provide an easy-to-use interface, supported by simple forms of input and concise
instructions that any user can follow—always assume that they aren’t as technically proficient as
you may be. For instance, if the program requires that the user picks an option from a list, instead
of having them manually type in the option, list the options with numbers, and have them enter
the number corresponding to their choice.<br>
● The app should work on Python 3.6+ installations.<br>
● App code must be well-formatted according to standardized guidelines<br>
● App code should also be supported by concise, helpful comments that illustrate the flow of the program
